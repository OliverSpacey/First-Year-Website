        The main class here allows the entire page to be altered so that it behaves the same on mobile and desktop.
        Within the main class there are 3 article classes, called 'articles'. These contain all of the content for each article in one place and 
        prevent elements from scattering around the page when changing styling. 

        In each article there is the title, image, a button, and the text of the article. The button that displays the text on the screen functions 
        in the same way as the dropdown menu button - requiring a hover or press to activate. For these articles, there is a button that clearly 
        shows how the story can be shown, or alternatively the image can be selected to display the text.

                            DAD has been awarded the 'Best Children's Game Company of The Year' award, adding another commendation to our list! 
                            This comes after DAD spent the year working entirely from home, with no contact with anyone not in their individual bubbles. 
                            The year has been incredibly tough for everyone and this award helps recognise the incredible work our team has done over the 
                            last 12 months, and demonstrates our committment to providing quality experiences no matter the circumstances.

                            Earlier this year our CEO, Oliver Spacey, visited a small village in Ghana where he handed out iPads to the 
                            children there in an effort to aid their ability to use virtual learning tools. 
                            This came after children across the world were denied true educational experiences as a result of covid, with many 
                            children missing entire years worth of work. Oliver hoped that by providing these children with iPads, they would 
                            be able to work from home and make up for the work they had missed. Tablets have also given these children the opportunity 
                            enhance the learning they were recieving previously, adding many more elements to it through a virtual environment.

                            The main office for DAD has been officially moved from our previous address in Wellingborough to a new one 
                            in a small village in Yorkshire. The office is actually a new house! It's the old vicarage of the town, and so 
                            holds some significance in the local community. But, the opportunity to use such a beautiful and remote location 
                            with so much history as our base of operations was too great to pass up. We are certain that this new location
                            will provide us with abundant opportunity to create the great games and experiences we always have, but now with
                            the added charm of the English countryside in them all!
