                <p>Welcome to Digital Assessment Dojo! (DAD for short) Please check out 'News' for information on our latest events, and if you want to contact our team then head over to the 'Contact us' page for info on how to do that!</p>

                <h2>Our mission:</h2>
                <p>Our mission at DAD is simple, we want to deliver quality, fun, and engaging games and puzzles for children worldwide. To achieve this, we take full advatange of our team of experts in their respective fields (information on the team can be found on 'About us', or by <a class="link" href="founders.html">clicking here</a>).</p>
                <br>
                <h2>Games and puzzles:</h2>
                <p>Our games and puzzles are the perfect learning tool for any child, and have been carefully and lovingly crafted by our team to be fun and practical!</p>
                <p>We believe companies like ourselves should ensure that both they, and the content they produce, is universally recognised, free to use, and trustworthy. Without these key characteristics, how can there be any certainty that your child is getting the tools they need? That is why we are proud to say we are all of those and more! Our team works day and night to create fun, engaging, and useful learning tools for children of all ages. One of these can be found in the 'Game' section from the navigation bar, sidebar, or by <a class="link" href="game.html">clicking here</a>.</p>

            <!--
            This sidebar acts to show off the other pages of the website from the home page and provide links to them.
            
            The sidebar will display at the bottom of the page on mobile and tablets (breakpoint at 800px) and display along 
            the side on a desktop screen (at any point over 800px).
        
            Additionally, the sidebar class contains 3 of the aside class "mainAside", which contains the content for each item 
            in the sidebar - e.g. the news section + the picture. So while the div class "sidebar" contains the three items (news, 
            about us, and the game), the aside class "mainAside contains the content for each".

            Using two different classes was especially important as I wanted to ensure the sidebar was displayed properly on mobile and 
            desktop devices (top to bottom on desktop, and left to right on mobile), but also as i wanted there to be a separation between 
            each item on desktop so the sidebar looked like it blended in better with the rest of the page.
